      <div class="first">
        <p>Faydra, Rogue Cyborg<br />
        <br />
        <small>
          Faydra's parents were corporate elites, and she grew up in the clutches of The Corporations.
          She was 12 when she disabled the tracker embedded in her skull, and made her escape into the real world. It's not a pretty sight, but at least it's real.
          Only problem is, everyone wants the corporate hardware inside her head. Good thing it makes her so damn hard to kill.

      <div class="second">
        <p>Genzer, Evolved Mutant<br />
        <br />
        <small>
          Genzer grew up in a corporate slum, working for scraps.
          When he got the chance to be in a clinical study and make some real money, he took it.
          The participants were injected with experimental serums, and most didn't survive.
          Genzer survived, horribly mutated, but with strange new abilities that he would turn against The Corporations.

      <div class="third">
        <p>Kili, Neon Rider<br />
        <br />
        <small>
          Kili was an orphan, like so many others, put to work at a corporate education facility.
          She escaped at the age of 9, but quickly found herself in Neon Rider territory. They gave her a choice: ride, or die. 
          Now she rides as one of them, and gives The Corporations something to fear.

      <div class="fourth">
        <p>Madrik, Obsessed Mage<br />
        <br />
        <small>
          Madrik was an aether engineer on a corporate colony, an indentured servant to Vektor.
          Though his life was dismal, he managed to find love, a wife.
          When she was caught stealing rations, she was executed without a momentâ€™s hesitation.
          The pain was unbearable to Madrik, and he vowed to bring her back, dedicating his life to the study of aethercraft.

      <div class="fifth">
        <p>Yergov, Biochemist<br />
        <br />
        <small>
          Yergov grew up in a region untouched by The Corporations, but inevitably, they found him.
          His parents were slaughtered while he watched from hiding. He alone survived, and fled his homeworld, plotting his revenge.
          For years, he studied the hidden powers of chemicals and elixirs, and has mastered many unnatural sciences.
