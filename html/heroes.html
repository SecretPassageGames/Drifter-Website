          Faydra, Rogue Cyborg<br />
          <br />
          <small>
            Faydra's parents were corporate elites, and she grew up in the
            clutches of The Corporations. She was 12 when she disabled the
            tracker embedded in her skull, and made her escape into the real
            world. It's not a pretty sight, but at least it's real. Only problem
            is, everyone wants the corporate hardware inside her head. Good
            thing it makes her so damn hard to kill.

          Genzer, Evolved Mutant<br />

          <small>
            Genzer grew up in a corporate slum, working for scraps. When he got
            the chance to be in a clinical study and make some real money, he
            took it. The participants were injected with experimental serums,
            and most didn't survive. Genzer survived, horribly mutated, but with
            strange new abilities that he would turn against The Corporations.

            Kili was an orphan, like so many others, put to work at a corporate
            education facility. She escaped at the age of 9, but quickly found
            herself in Neon Rider territory. They gave her a choice: ride, or
            die. Now she rides as one of them, and gives The Corporations
            something to fear.

          Madrik, Obsessed Mage<br />

          <small>
            Madrik was an aether engineer on a corporate colony, an indentured
            servant to Vektor. Though his life was dismal, he managed to find
            love, a wife. When she was caught stealing rations, she was executed
            without a moment's hesitation. The pain was unbearable to Madrik,
            and he vowed to bring her back, dedicating his life to the study of
            aethercraft.

            Yergov grew up in a region untouched by The Corporations, but
            inevitably, they found him. His parents were slaughtered while he
            watched from hiding. He alone survived, and fled his homeworld,
            plotting his revenge. For years, he studied the hidden powers of
            chemicals and elixirs, and has mastered many unnatural sciences.
